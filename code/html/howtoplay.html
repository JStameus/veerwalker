    <h2>How To Play</h2>
    <section>
        <p>Currently, the game conists of two phases: text-based dialogue/storytelling where the story is told through text, and you advance the story by picking from a range of things to say or do. The other phase is turn-based combat, where you and the AI take turns rolling dice to attack one another until either side is defeated.</p>
        <p>All game interaction can be done with the mouse. Just select the dialogue option or action you want at the bottom of the screen, in the control panel.</p>
        <p>Encounters: To attack a target, click on it and select "Attack". If you want to skip the turn(for some reason), click "Skip Turn".</p>
