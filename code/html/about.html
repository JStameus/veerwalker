        <h2>About the Developer</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm Joseph. I'm an aspiring web developer/programmer with a background in game development and 3D art. I'm currently studying web development and I'm making this game as a student project, with the hope that I can continue expanding on the idea as I learn more.</p>

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>The first "phase" of the project is only meant to include a small portion of the finished game, and I'll focus only on making the text-based dialogue and turn-based encounters. The goal is to get these two parts polished and fun enough to stand on their own, but in the future, there are quite a few more features I'm hoping to add, depending on how much time I have, and how difficult it turns out to be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A finished and complete storyline</li>
            <li>Tiled world overview map with settlements, random encounters and points of interest</li>
            <li>Fully functional quest system</li>
            <li>A simple simulated economy with crafting and trading</li>
            <li>The ability to build settlements</li>
            <li>Faction system</li>
            <li>Endless dungeons</li>
            <li>Multiplayer?!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Like I said, quite a bit. It may take years, if I even finish it at all. We'll see!</p>
