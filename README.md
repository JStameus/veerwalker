### Project Overview

Veerwalker is meant to be a casual, browser-based sandbox RPG/Strategy game where the player
travels around a world map, trading, fighting, exploring, and gathering resources to
support their allied faction or nation, or for themselves. 

While the full game is too big of a challenge and commitment for me to create right now, 
this first part, which is a project of eight weeks, is intended to be a vertical slice of
one part of the game, namely text-based dialogue and turn-based encounters. The game will 
feature very little in the way of detailed graphics, focusing instead on mechanical and 
narrative depth, inspired by tabletop roleplaying games such as Dungeons & Dragons. 

That means NO FANCY GRAPHICS OR TYPICAL GAME MECHANICS, everything is meant to be purely 
based on the user interface, more like a typical web page.

The focus of this "module" will be on the most basic fundamental aspects of the game, in
which the story is told through narrative text and dialogue, and some of that dialogue can 
be influenced by player choices. All dialogue is saved in "dialogue trees" where each piece of dialogue
(shown in the main window on the upper half of the screen) contains text and a collection of possible
choices, which in turn point to a new piece of dialogue that contains a new set of responses etc etc. 

The other part is encounters, which can be triggered by dialogue. In the encounters, the player and the 
computer-controlled characters take turns rolling dice to attack one another, until either the "monsters" or
all player characters are knocked out. 

As a part of this project, I should create decent tools, or at least customizeable objects in the code, that
will allow me to easily create new content abiding by these simple design principles. The full game should 
contain a lot more content than this, and I'll need a way to easily create that content in the future.

### Tools

I'll try to design the game in a way that enables me to use as few external programs as possible, 
so I'll be using a code editor for HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as well as Photoshop(maybe illustrator) for
art assets when needed. 

Later on, I might use Blender for simple 3d models that I can paint over to create sprites, and depending 
on the scope of the future game, I'll figure out which tools to use then. But for now, I'll keep it VERY simple.

### Documentation

**TEACHERS, LOOK HERE!**

I'll keep a development journal(in Swedish) for my teachers to keep track of my progress. Everything that they
need to keep up with my progress will be stored in my git repository at: 
  https://github.com/JStameus/veerwalker/tree/master/documentation
  
For the benefit of myself and my teachers, I will also keep track of my current tasks here on GitHub in the Projects tab.
That way, if I am stuck on a task or don't know how to proceed, it'll be easier for my teachers to get an overview of what 
I'm doing.
