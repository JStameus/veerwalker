[Canvas]
Canvas doesn't scale with screen, is that possible to do? Would be sweet.

[Characters]
I can create new Character objects, but how will I store them later, and where?

[Getting Started]
I'll try the dialogues first. I'll leave the encounters for now and just focus
on making simple dialogues. I just need to figure out how to switch between dialogues
and encounters later on, without having to reload the page.

[Making Progress & dialogueNodes]
I'm starting to make sense of things. I have objects called dialogueNode(s) that contain
some text and scene information, as well as references to possible responses. However,
there is one problem: dialogueNodes and dialogueChoices are trying to access properties of
one another before they are initialized. If I move one further up in the code, something else breaks.
How do I get around this? 

[Changing let to var]
Changing the "nodes" and dialogue options to use var instead of let at their declaration fixed the issue,
but I'm not sure if it is the optimal solution?

[DialogueNode Constructors]
Is there a way to specify that a DialogueResponse needs a DialogueNode in the
first parameter or do I just have to keep track of that myself?

Also, I should create DialogueResponsed INSIDE the DialogueNodes. That way they 
won't clutter up my code and I won't have to keep track of the parent nodes, not 
to mention how much easier it will be to name them since they'll be confined
within the individual dialogue nodes.

[Script Communicaition]
How do I ensure that all my scripts can communicate with one another? I want to be able to divide
all my scripts as much as possible to avoid cluttered code.
