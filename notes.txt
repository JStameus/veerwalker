TO DO

- Change checkGameOver() implementation so that the function itself can end an encounter,
  so that the nextTurn() doesn't have to. That way it can also decide which team won.

- Change the control panel so that "actions" and "responses" are treated the same.

- Restructure the dialoguemanager to divide it into classes, and take the encounterUIManager
  and make it into a universal UI manager script
