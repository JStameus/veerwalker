***LOCATIONS***

**Vornioss:** The entirety of the known world, the last bastion against the Withersea. Vornioss is comprised of the Reach Worlds, The Pillarscape, and The Observer.

**The Reach Worlds:** The asteroid belts, planet fragments and moons orbiting the Pillarscape. Mostly barren, but there are a few large masses of habitable land.

**The Pillarscape:** The "main" part of Vornioss, the unfinished sphere and the planes that constitute the landmass, bound together by a central Pillar. 

**Parndra:** The largest "plane" of the Pillarscape, the overworld.

**Yunir:** Parndra's underworld, where the sun never shines and rain goes "upwards", down into Derva.

**Derva:** The world at the bottom of the pillar, an "inverted" hollow moon, acting as the basin for the Pillarscape's water flow. In essence, it is the Pillarscape's recycling plant, funneling water from the top and back up into the pillar.

**Heloss:** The "umbrella" at the top of the pillar, a large dome partiall covering the upper half of the Pillarscape.

***MAGIC & MYSTERY***

**The Wordly Machines:** The Pillarscape's internal organs, monitoring and managing all key systems that make the world habitable.

- **The Beacon:** Manages heat and light. Used for fire magic, simple light and shadow bending.
- **The Tempest:** Manages water flow, weather conditions and atmosphere. 
- **The Heart:** Produces and pumps the Pillarscape's nutrients and "blood" throughout the Veins.
- **The Veins:** Acts as the primary mode of transportation for both data and materials throughout the Pillarscape, as well as provide structure for landmass.
- **The Veil:** Obscures vision between levels and provides localized illusions to give the impression of a "real" sky.
- **The Tether:** Creates artificial localized gravity along the planes and the surface of the Pillar, and helps keep the Reach Worlds in orbit.
- **The Observer:** Monitors status of all living organisms in Vornioss, communicates telepathically with other machines and coordinates Functionaries.

**Machine Avatars:** Elementals of a sort, either fully artificial or cybernetically enhanced humanoids, who do the bidding of the Worldly Machine they belong to. 

**Functionaries:** Insect-like robotic constructs that maintain the world according to the machine's instructions, such as "weaving" landmass together, planting seeds, culling wildlife and safekeeping the natural order.

**Siryvians:** Tall, hooded creatures from beyond the Withersea, said to have come from the planet Siryv, now destroyed by the Pillarscape's creator in the formation of the Reach Worlds.

**Ivirixis:** A deity, a mad genius, a feeling, an idea. It is not clear exactly *what* Ivirixis is, but the most commonly held belief is that it resides at the top of the Pillar, and is intimately linked to the Wordly Machines and the creation of the Pillarscape.

**The Silent Stewards:** Five godesses who once watched over the Pillarscape, tasked with finishing its creation and leading all mortals to a golden age of peace and prosperity. They are long dead now, but some still hold out hope that they'll return and save us all.

- **Tereiva:** The Steward of Rainwreath, in Southern Yet Sur.
- **Yrix:** The Steward of Bearer's Bridge, in Central Yet Sur.
- **Jazai:** The Steward of Reacher's Brink, in Northern Seyv.
- **Tuzik:** Steward of The Orriad, in Central Seyv.
- **Uzira:** Steward of The Enn, in Southern Seyv.

***RACES*** 

**Human:** Arrived in Vornioss in a fleet of shimmering vessels, and awakened in the cities of the Silent Stewards. Before their new utopia could be realized, the Tuawik tore down their walls and murdered the Stewards, leaving humanity scattered or enslaved for hundreds of years.

**Tuawik:** Hive-dwelling ogres, born in the depths of Yunir by the mysterious creature known as Moddawik. They reproduce by splicing genes from other species and use their **biological** material to create new lifeforms. At the time of the First Reunion, they conqured the humans, enslaved them and used their genes to create the Wonu.

**Wonu:** Elves, the descendants of the Tuawik. At the time of the Tuawik Dominion, the Wonu were destined to replace the Tuawik as the new champions of the Moddawik. But, due to internal conflicts and the subsequent fall of the Dominion, they were spread across Parndra and Yunir into many different nations. Some are more like their Tuawik ancestors, while others look more like humans.

**Phamanca:** Tall, sturdy beast-like humanoids from Derva, with mighty horns, hooves and covered in fur. Not many remain in Derva, and have settled more in the northern regions of Parndra. Most well known for their advances in astronomy and various geographic discoveries.

**Terrodunian:** Mutated humans who crash-landed on the dark side of the moon Terrodun at the beginning of the First Reunion. Short, pale and often with harsh facial features, the Terrodunians are uniquely adapted to life in the Reach Worlds, and are tough and enduring.
